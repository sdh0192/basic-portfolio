            Hey! My name is Scott Hastings. Thank you for visiting my site! A little history on myself...
            I was born in New Orleans, LA to a middle-class family. I moved to Texas at the age of 7, where 
            I attended middle school, high school and some college. I then moved to Miami in the summer of 2014
            and began working in the field of substance abuse treatment, and have worked there ever since! Although
            that field can be very rewarding at times, it is usually very emotionally taxing, and my hope is to begin
            and build a career in technology, specifically software development, which was my original passion as a kid.
            Hopefully you find some things you like on here that I have created, by clicking on "Portfolio" at the top,
            and feel free to message me by clicking on "Contact" as well!
